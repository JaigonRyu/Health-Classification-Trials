Heart disease is a major medical issue in the United States, affecting many Americans every year. As rates of heart disease continue to rise and overall healthy lifestyles trend down in the country, many are researching easy to help diagnose and prevent heart disease. Recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to try and predict heart disease-related events using specific attributes and predictors. Following this, I used four unique unsupervised machine learning classifiers to help predict data from four datasets dealing with heart disease. I compared the results after preprocessing, training, validating, and testing all the data with different training/testing splits(80/20, 50/50, 20/80). They showed that the best classifiers were the SVMs and decision tree classifiers. The worst being logistic regression. The results also revealed that an 80 training 20 testing split yields the best attesting accuracy on unseen data. Utilizing the best classifiers and testing techniques to get reliable results can build on the effort to help diagnose heart disease quicker and identify key predictive markers better.
